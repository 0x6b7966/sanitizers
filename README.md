# sanitizers
This project is the home for Sanitizers: AddressSanitizer, MemorySanitizer, ThreadSanitizer, LeakSanitizer. 
The actual code resides in the [LLVM](http://llvm.org) repository.
Here we keep extended [documentation](../../wiki), [bugs](../../issues) and some helper code. 

We have recently migrated from code.google.com to github, many links will be broken.
